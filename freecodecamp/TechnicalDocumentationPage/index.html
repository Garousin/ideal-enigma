      <li>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and managing relational databases. It provides a standardized way of interacting with databases, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. SQL is widely used in various applications, from simple data retrieval to complex database management systems.</li>
      <p>In this section, we will explore the key features of SQL and its role in modern database management.</p>
      <li>SQL is designed to be a simple yet powerful language for managing and querying databases. Its syntax is straightforward, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.</li>
      <p>Whether you are a developer, data analyst, or database administrator, understanding SQL is essential for working with relational databases effectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="prerequisites">
      <header> Prerequisites </header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of databases and their structure.</li>
        <li>Familiarity with basic database concepts like tables, rows, and columns.</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to SQL, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about SQL.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before diving into SQL, it's helpful to have a solid foundation in database concepts and a basic understanding of how data is organized and managed.</p>

      <header> SQL Overview </header>
      <p>SQL is a declarative language that allows users to define the desired result set without specifying the exact steps to obtain it. It consists of various statements for different operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more. SQL is used to interact with relational databases, where data is organized into tables with predefined columns and data types.</p>
      <p>Understanding the fundamentals of SQL is crucial for anyone working with databases. Whether you are building a new application or analyzing existing data, SQL provides powerful tools for managing and querying information.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="basic_syntax">
      <header> Basic Syntax </header>
      <p>The basic syntax of SQL involves using statements to perform specific tasks. Common tasks include querying data, updating records, and modifying database structure.</p>
      <code>SELECT column1, column2 FROM table WHERE condition;</code>
      <code>UPDATE table SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;</code>
      <code>DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;</code>
      <p>Each SQL statement follows a specific syntax, and understanding the structure is essential for writing effective queries. Whether you are retrieving information or making changes to the database, mastering the basic syntax is the first step towards becoming proficient in SQL.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
      <header> Data Types </header>
      <p>SQL supports various data types for defining columns in a table. Common data types include INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, and more.</p>
      <p>Understanding data types is crucial for designing a well-structured database. Each data type serves a specific purpose and helps ensure data integrity and accuracy.</p>
      <p>In addition to the primitive data types, SQL allows users to define custom data types and constraints to meet specific application requirements.</p>
      <code>CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(255), birthdate DATE);</code>
      <code>ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name new_data_type;</code>
      <p>Choosing the right data types for your database columns is a critical decision. It impacts storage efficiency, query performance, and overall data quality.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="queries">
      <header> Queries </header>
      <p>SQL queries are used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. The SELECT statement is fundamental for querying data.</p>
      <code>SELECT column1, column2 FROM table WHERE condition;</code>
      <code>SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;</code>
      <p>Writing effective queries requires a solid understanding of the underlying data model and the specific information you need. Whether you are extracting reports or analyzing trends, mastering SQL queries is key to unlocking the potential of your database.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="joins">
      <header> Joins </header>
      <p>Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.</p>
      <code>SELECT * FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;</code>
      <code>SELECT * FROM orders LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;</code>
      <p>Understanding how to use joins effectively is essential for querying data from multiple tables. Whether you are building complex reports or extracting insights from diverse datasets, SQL joins are a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p>
