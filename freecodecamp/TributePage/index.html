            <figcaption id="img-caption">Jose Rizal is arguably the Philippines' biggest national hero. Jose would be a child prodigy in school for his writing, reading, and art and would quickly learn multiple languages. His wealthy parents would allow Jose to focus his career on academics. While he was a young man in Brussels, Spain, and Germany, he would publish nationalistic writings supporting nationalism in the Philippines and more Filipino political rights from Spain. His work inspired peaceful change, non-peaceful change, and Filipino nationalism.
